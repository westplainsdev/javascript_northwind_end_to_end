# THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ARCHIVED 
Due to the large number of out of date node_modules and the ever increasing security threat that is presented by these modules
we have decided to archive this project. Everything here has been made read only and we are no longer accepting pull requests, 
bug fixes or enhancements.

## End to End Demo
This demo contains two node.js applications and allows one to talk to a second one which connects to a Microsoft SQL server database. 

## Quick Start ##
To get the demonstration to run locally, you will need to have Nodejs installed. You will need to have a Microsoft SQL server installed, with a SQL server user account on it. 

First things first, run NPM update within each applications root folder to bring in all of the necessary NPM packages required for the sites to run. Inside the MS connect application folder, you can find the scripts required to create the Northwind database required for this demo. 

Each application also has a specific README.md file which goes into further details about the application.
